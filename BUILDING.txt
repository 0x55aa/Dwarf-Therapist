Instructions for how to build from source are as follows:

For Windows, download the QTCreator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro file.  You can build
from within QTCreator.

For Linux, do the following:

# Install the qt5 dev tools and qtchooser.  You're on your own for non-debian-derived systems.
	> sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qtchooser
	or you can use your favorite package manager.

# Clone the project using git
	> git clone git://github.com/splintermind/Dwarf-Therapist.git

# Build the project
	> cd Dwarf-Therapist
	> qmake -qt=5
	> make

This will take some time.  Get a cup of coffee.

The executable is in your /usr/bin folder  You will have to run it as sudo, i.e.:
	(from a command line)
	>sudo dwarftherapist

If your build fails, the easiest way to start over again is to go to the df_linux folder and run
	> rm -rf Dwarf-Therapist
